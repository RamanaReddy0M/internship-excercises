    The time is the number of milliseconds since midnight, January 1, 1970,
Greenwich Mean Time. However, in older VMs the conversion between this long
and a real date is platform-dependent, so it’s only useful for comparing the modi-
fication dates of different files, not for determining the absolute time a file was
modified. This method throws a security exception if the security manager
doesn’t allow the file to be read. It returns 0 if the file doesn’t exist or the last
modified date can’t be determined.
